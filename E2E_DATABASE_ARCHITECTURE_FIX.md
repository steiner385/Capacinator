# E2E Database Architecture Fix - Complete

## Problem Summary
The E2E tests were failing because the system was using an in-memory SQLite database (`:memory:`), which cannot be shared between processes. The `init-e2e.ts` script ran in a separate process, creating the database in memory, but the server process couldn't access it.

## Root Cause
In-memory SQLite databases are process-specific and cannot be accessed by other processes, even if they're part of the same application.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created File-Based E2E Database Configuration
- **File**: `/src/server/database/knexfile.e2e.ts`
- Uses a file-based SQLite database at `.e2e-data/e2e-test.db`
- Optimized for test performance with settings like `synchronous = OFF`

### 2. Updated Main Knexfile
- **File**: `/src/server/database/knexfile.ts`
- Added logic to use E2E config when `NODE_ENV=e2e`
- Imports and uses the E2E configuration automatically

### 3. Updated Database Initialization
- **File**: `/src/server/database/init-e2e.ts`
- Changed from in-memory to file-based database
- Added cleanup logic to delete database file before initialization
- Ensures fresh state for each test run

### 4. Updated Server Integration
- **File**: `/src/server/index.ts`
- Already had E2E database initialization logic
- Works seamlessly with new file-based approach

### 5. Updated Scripts
- **Files**: 
  - `/scripts/start-e2e-server.sh` - Removed separate init-e2e call
  - `/scripts/stop-e2e-server.sh` - Added database file cleanup
  - `/scripts/e2e-server-manager.sh` - Integrated cleanup and removed init call

## Benefits
1. **Reliability**: Database is accessible across all processes
2. **Isolation**: Each test run starts with a clean database
3. **Performance**: Optimized settings for fast test execution
4. **Debuggability**: Can inspect database file if tests fail

## Test Results
- ✅ Server starts successfully with file-based database
- ✅ Database migrations run correctly
- ✅ Test data seeds properly
- ✅ All smoke tests pass (8/8)
- ✅ API endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Data persistence works across requests

## Files Modified

1. `/src/server/database/knexfile.e2e.ts` - Created
2. `/src/server/database/knexfile.ts` - Modified to use E2E config
3. `/src/server/database/init-e2e.ts` - Updated to use file-based DB
4. `/src/server/database/index.ts` - Minor update for E2E mode
5. `/scripts/start-e2e-server.sh` - Removed init-e2e call
6. `/scripts/stop-e2e-server.sh` - Added DB cleanup
7. `/scripts/e2e-server-manager.sh` - Updated for file-based DB

## Usage

### Start E2E Environment
```bash
# Using the enhanced server manager
./scripts/e2e-server-manager.sh start

# Or using npm scripts
npm run e2e:start
```

### Stop E2E Environment
```bash
# Stop and clean up database
./scripts/e2e-server-manager.sh stop --cleanup-db

# Or using npm scripts
npm run e2e:stop:cleanup
```

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/25-quick-smoke-test.spec.ts
```

## Conclusion
The database architecture issue has been fully resolved. The E2E tests now use a reliable file-based SQLite database that can be accessed by all processes, ensuring consistent and reliable test execution.
