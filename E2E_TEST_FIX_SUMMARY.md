# E2E Test Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The E2E tests weren't automatically starting the server because of configuration issues:

1. **Missing Audit Configuration**: The audit service wasn't enabled in the E2E environment
2. **Database Configuration Conflict**: The global setup was trying to override the database to use `:memory:` which conflicted with the E2E configuration

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `.env.e2e` file:
```env
# Enable audit service for E2E tests
AUDIT_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES=1000
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=365
AUDIT_ENABLED_TABLES=people,projects,roles,assignments,availability,project_assignments,scenario_project_assignments
AUDIT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS=password,token,secret,key,hash
```

### 2. Updated `e2e-global-setup.ts`:
- Removed the DATABASE_URL and DB_FILENAME overrides that were forcing `:memory:`
- Added audit service environment variables to the server startup configuration
- Let the E2E configuration use its intended file-based database

## Results

✅ **E2E tests are now running successfully!**

### Test Results:
- **15 tests passing** ✅ - Core audit functionality works:
  - Project CRUD audit logging
  - Assignment audit logging
  - Sensitive field redaction
  - Retention policy enforcement
  - User activity tracking
  - Bulk operations
  - Search and filtering

- **12 tests failing** ✘ - Advanced features not yet implemented:
  - Undo/Redo operations (API endpoints missing)
  - Audit reporting analytics (API endpoints missing)
  - Max history enforcement endpoint

## Key Insights

1. **Server Startup**: The E2E server now starts correctly with NODE_ENV=e2e and uses the proper database configuration
2. **Audit Service**: The audit service initializes properly when AUDIT_ENABLED=true is set
3. **Database Strategy**: E2E tests use a file-based SQLite database at `.e2e-data/e2e-test.db` for proper cross-process access

## Next Steps

The core audit functionality is fully working in E2E tests. The failing tests are for advanced features that would need to be implemented:
- `/api/audit/undo` and `/api/audit/redo` endpoints
- `/api/audit/summary` and `/api/audit/timeline` endpoints
- Max history enforcement logic

The E2E test infrastructure is now properly configured and ready for use.
