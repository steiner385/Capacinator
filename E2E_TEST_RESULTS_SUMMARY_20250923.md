# E2E Test Results Summary - September 23, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Database Architecture Issue - RESOLVED
**Problem**: E2E tests used in-memory SQLite database that couldn't be shared between processes
**Root Cause**: SQLite `:memory:` databases are process-specific
**Solution**: 
- Created file-based E2E database configuration (`knexfile.e2e.ts`)
- Database now uses `.e2e-data/e2e-test.db` file
- Updated all scripts to use file-based approach
**Result**: Database is now accessible across all processes

### 2. ✅ Missing person_availability_view - RESOLVED  
**Problem**: AssignmentsController referenced `person_availability_view` that didn't exist
**Solution**: Created migration `026_add_person_availability_view.ts`
**Result**: View now exists and assignments can check availability

### 3. ✅ Server Connection Issues - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Tests couldn't connect to E2E servers (port mismatches)
**Solution**: 
- Fixed port configuration to consistently use 3110/3120
- Created robust server management scripts
- Added health checks and retry logic
**Result**: Servers start reliably with correct ports

## Test Execution Status

### Passing Test Groups
- ✅ **Smoke Tests**: All smoke tests passing
- ✅ **Server Health**: Server health checks passing
- ✅ **Basic API**: API connectivity verified

### Test Execution Challenges
- ⏱️ **Timeouts**: Some test groups timing out after 5 minutes
- This appears to be due to the large number of tests running sequentially
- Individual tests are passing when run separately

## Current State
1. **Infrastructure**: Working correctly
   - E2E servers starting properly
   - Database migrations applied
   - File-based database accessible
   
2. **Core Functionality**: Verified
   - API endpoints responding
   - Database queries working
   - Basic CRUD operations functional

3. **Test Suite**: Needs optimization
   - Many tests taking too long to complete
   - May need parallel execution or test splitting

## Recommendations

### 1. Run Tests in Smaller Groups
Instead of running all tests at once, run specific test suites:
```bash
# Run CRUD tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/suites/crud

# Run report tests  
npx playwright test tests/e2e/suites/reports

# Run specific feature tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/suites/features/dashboard
```

### 2. Use Parallel Execution
```bash
# Run with more workers
npx playwright test --workers=4

# Or update playwright.config.ts to enable parallel execution
```

### 3. Debug Long-Running Tests
Some tests may have unnecessary waits or inefficient selectors. Profile individual slow tests:
```bash
# Run with trace to identify bottlenecks
npx playwright test --trace on tests/e2e/slow-test.spec.ts
```

## Files Modified

### Database & Infrastructure
1. `/src/server/database/knexfile.e2e.ts` - Created file-based E2E config
2. `/src/server/database/knexfile.ts` - Updated to use E2E config when NODE_ENV=e2e
3. `/src/server/database/init-e2e.ts` - Updated to use file-based database
4. `/src/server/database/migrations/026_add_person_availability_view.ts` - Created missing view
5. `/scripts/e2e-server-manager.sh` - Enhanced server management
6. `/scripts/start-e2e-server.sh` - Fixed port configuration
7. `/scripts/stop-e2e-server.sh` - Added database cleanup

### Test Utilities
1. `/tests/e2e/config/e2e.config.ts` - Centralized E2E configuration

## Summary
The main infrastructure issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Database architecture fixed (file-based instead of in-memory)
- ✅ Missing database views created
- ✅ Server connection issues resolved
- ✅ Port configuration standardized

The E2E test suite is now functional but may need optimization for faster execution. All critical blocking issues have been addressed.
