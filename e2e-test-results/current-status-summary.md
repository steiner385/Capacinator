# E2E Test Current Status Summary

## Infrastructure Status
✅ **Server Management Fixed**
- Backend running on port 3110 (healthy)
- Frontend running on port 3120 (healthy)
- Robust server manager script created with proper health checks

## Test Results So Far

### ✅ Passing Tests
1. **Smoke Tests** (4/4 passed)
   - Basic infrastructure test
   - Navigation between pages
   - Sidebar navigation
   - Main content area display

### ❌ Known Issues

1. **Write Operations Test Hanging**
   - Test: `21-write-operations.spec.ts`
   - Issue: Test hangs when trying to create a new project
   - Likely cause: Modal or form interaction not working properly

2. **Test Infrastructure Issues**
   - Many tests are experiencing timeouts
   - Profile selection modal appearing multiple times
   - Tests creating data but not cleaning up properly (orphaned test data)

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Profile Selection Modal**
   - Appearing even after authentication state is saved
   - Multiple test users being created and appearing in dropdown
   - Needs better handling in test setup

2. **Page Content Detection**
   - Some tests timing out with "No specific content found"
   - Page structure may have changed

3. **Test Data Pollution**
   - Previous test runs left data: 
     - write-ops-Project-To-Edit-Owner
     - data-rel-Person-1
     - apisec-Person-1/2
   - Need better cleanup between test runs

## Fixes Already Applied

1. ✅ Import settings JSON parsing (ImportController)
2. ✅ Project creation form (added sub-type selection)
3. ✅ Data relationship queries (View Details button)
4. ✅ API validation error codes
5. ✅ Workload insights selectors
6. ✅ Navigation error handling
7. ✅ Server connection issues (complete fix)

## Next Steps

1. Clean up orphaned test data
2. Fix profile selection handling in tests
3. Update page content selectors
4. Run focused tests on remaining failures
5. Fix any remaining test issues
