# API Contracts: Fix CI Test Failures

**Feature**: 004-fix-ci-failures

## Not Applicable

This feature focuses on fixing test reliability issues. No API contracts are affected:

- **phaseDurations.ts**: Internal utility function, not an API endpoint
- **LocationModal.test.tsx**: Test file only, no API changes

The fixes involve:
1. Correcting a test assertion value
2. Fixing async test patterns

No new endpoints, no schema changes, no contract modifications required.
