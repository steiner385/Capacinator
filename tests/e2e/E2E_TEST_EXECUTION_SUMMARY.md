# E2E Test Execution Summary

## Test Run Results

### Overall Status
- **Total Tests**: 621 tests identified across all suites
- **Test Suites**: 51 test files organized in 12 categories
- **Execution Issues**: Some tests failing due to test data initialization problems

### Smoke Tests Results
From the smoke test execution:
- ✅ **Server health check**: Passed
- ✅ **Dashboard page loads**: Passed  
- ✅ **Projects page is accessible**: Passed
- ✅ **People page shows data**: Passed
- ✅ **Assignments page is accessible**: Passed
- ✅ **Reports page shows tabs**: Passed
- ✅ **No console errors on main pages**: Passed
- ✅ **API endpoints respond**: Passed
- ✅ **Search functionality exists**: Passed
- ✅ **Data relationships work**: Passed
- ✅ **Forms work**: Passed

### API Tests Results
The API test suite showed failures due to undefined test data:
- ❌ 14 tests failed due to `testData` being undefined
- ✅ 2 tests passed (error handling tests)

### Issues Identified

1. **Test Data Initialization**
   - API tests are not properly receiving test data from fixtures
   - The `testData` object is undefined in several tests

2. **Profile Selection Delays**
   - Initial profile selection taking 30+ seconds
   - Warning about `/api/profiles` returning 404
   - Multiple retries needed for profile selection

3. **Test Structure Issues**
   - Fixed syntax error in `people.spec.ts`
   - Some archived tests have missing imports

### Performance Observations

1. **Setup Time**
   - Global setup: ~30 seconds (includes DB initialization)
   - Profile selection: ~30 seconds per worker
   - Total initialization: ~1 minute

2. **Test Execution**
   - Smoke tests: Running successfully
   - Workers: 4 concurrent workers active
   - Individual test times: 45ms - 47s

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Test Data Issues**
   - Update API tests to properly initialize test data
   - Ensure fixtures are correctly passed to all test types

2. **Optimize Profile Selection**
   - Cache profile selection across workers
   - Reduce timeout delays

3. **Run Focused Test Suites**
   - Use project-based execution for faster feedback
   - Example: `npm test -- --project=smoke`

## Next Steps

1. Fix the API test data initialization issue
2. Run full test suite with fixes
3. Generate performance report
4. Address any remaining failures

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific suite
npx playwright test tests/e2e/suites/smoke

# Run with specific project
npx playwright test --project=api

# Run with single worker for debugging
npx playwright test --workers=1

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test --ui
```

## Summary

The E2E test infrastructure is working, but there are some initialization issues to resolve:
- Smoke tests are passing successfully
- API tests need test data fixes
- Profile selection process needs optimization
- Overall structure and organization is good
