# E2E Test Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the standardization of the Capacinator E2E test suite, consolidating 125+ test files into a well-organized, maintainable structure.

## Migration Status

### âœ… Completed
1. **Test Framework Infrastructure**
   - Created unified test fixtures (`tests/e2e/fixtures/index.ts`)
   - Consolidated Playwright configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
   - Standardized authentication handling
   - Created global setup/teardown
   - Added test tags for selective execution

2. **Test Suite Organization**
   ```
   tests/e2e/suites/
   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ navigation.spec.ts (migrated from multiple navigation tests)
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ table-navigation.spec.ts (migrated from simple-table-tests.spec.ts)
   â”œâ”€â”€ crud/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assignments.spec.ts (new comprehensive suite)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ people.spec.ts (migrated from people.spec.ts)
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ projects.spec.ts (migrated from projects.spec.ts)
   â”œâ”€â”€ reports/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reports-comprehensive.spec.ts (consolidated from 11 report tests)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ capacity-report-accuracy.spec.ts
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ demand-report-accuracy.spec.ts
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utilization-report-accuracy.spec.ts
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gaps-analysis-accuracy.spec.ts
   â””â”€â”€ smoke/
       â””â”€â”€ smoke-tests.spec.ts (consolidated quick validation tests)
   ```

3. **Test Patterns Established**
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Standardized test structure
   - Unified helper methods
   - Common fixtures for authentication and data
   - Tagged test execution (@smoke, @crud, @reports, @critical)

### ðŸ”„ Migration Approach

#### High-Value Tests Migrated
- Simple table navigation tests â†’ `core/table-navigation.spec.ts`
- People CRUD operations â†’ `crud/people.spec.ts`  
- Projects CRUD operations â†’ `crud/projects.spec.ts`
- Report accuracy tests â†’ `reports/*-accuracy.spec.ts`
- Quick smoke tests â†’ `smoke/smoke-tests.spec.ts`

#### Duplicate Tests Archived
- 9 assignment test variations consolidated into one comprehensive suite
- 11 reports test files merged into organized report suites
- 14 scenario test duplicates identified for future consolidation

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Fix Global Setup Profile Selection**
   - Update `e2e-global-setup.ts` to handle profile selection correctly
   - Ensure consistent authentication across all test runs

2. **Migrate Remaining High-Value Tests**
   - Scenario management tests
   - Excel import functionality
   - Dashboard visualizations
   - API integration tests

3. **Create Missing Table Tests**
   - Availability page table
   - Settings page user permissions table
   - ProjectPhaseManager table

4. **Clean Up Legacy Tests**
   - Archive remaining duplicate tests
   - Remove old test helpers
   - Update documentation

## Usage

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run Specific Suites
```bash
# Smoke tests only
npm run test:e2e:smoke

# CRUD tests only
npm run test:e2e -- --grep @crud

# Reports tests only
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/suites/reports

# Specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/suites/crud/assignments.spec.ts
```

### Run in Different Modes
```bash
# Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# UI mode
npx playwright test --ui
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Test Duplication**: From 125+ files to ~15 organized suites
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Consistent patterns and shared utilities
3. **Better Performance**: Parallel execution and optimized setups
4. **Clear Organization**: Logical grouping by functionality
5. **Selective Execution**: Tag-based test running
6. **Unified Configuration**: Single config file for all tests

## Migration Guide for New Tests

See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on:
- Converting existing tests to the new pattern
- Creating new tests using standardized fixtures
- Using test helpers and utilities
- Following naming conventions

## Known Issues

1. **Profile Selection**: Global setup needs fixing for automatic profile selection
2. **Bash Execution**: Some environments have issues with bash command execution
3. **Flaky Tests**: Some tests need retry logic for stability

## Maintenance

- Run tests regularly in CI/CD
- Monitor test execution times
- Update fixtures as application evolves
- Add new test patterns as needed
- Keep test data realistic and minimal
