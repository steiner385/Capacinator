## Recommendations

### Tests to Keep:
1. **assignment-crud-complete.spec.ts** - Most comprehensive, well-organized test suite
2. **assignment-simple-crud.spec.ts** - Good for quick smoke tests

### Tests to Consider Removing:
1. **assignment-crud-fixed.spec.ts** - Subset of complete tests
2. **assignment-crud-working.spec.ts** - Duplicate functionality with less coverage
3. **assignment-crud-final.spec.ts** - Similar to complete but less comprehensive
4. **assignment-crud-comprehensive.spec.ts** - Has unique test data generation but otherwise duplicates complete

### Unique Features Worth Preserving:
- Random test data generation from comprehensive.spec.ts
- Navigation helper from final.spec.ts
- Complete lifecycle single test approach from comprehensive/fixed

### Consolidation Strategy:
1. Use assignment-crud-complete.spec.ts as the main test suite
2. Add random test data generation from comprehensive.spec.ts
3. Keep assignment-simple-crud.spec.ts for quick validation
4. Remove the other 4 files to avoid maintenance overhead
