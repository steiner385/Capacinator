# Integration Tests Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive integration tests have been created for the utilization report functionality and allocation validation to ensure the fixes for blank utilization charts are working correctly.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `utilization-report-api.test.ts`
Tests for the utilization report API endpoint that calculates and returns utilization data.

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Empty utilization when no assignments exist
- ✅ Correct utilization calculation for single assignment
- ✅ Aggregation of multiple assignments
- ✅ Handling assignments with null dates (using project dates)
- ✅ Date range filtering
- ✅ Overallocation handling and health summary

**Key Validations:**
- Date filtering works correctly (assignments outside date range are excluded)
- Allocation percentages are calculated accurately
- Health summary categorizes allocations correctly (healthy/warning/critical)
- Peak and average utilization metrics are correct

### 2. `allocation-validation.test.ts`
Tests for allocation percentage validation in the assignments controller.

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Rejection of assignments with allocation <= 0%
- ✅ Rejection of assignments with allocation > 200%
- ✅ Acceptance of valid allocation percentages (1-200%)
- ✅ Creation of assignments that cause overallocation (with warning)
- ✅ Update validation for existing assignments
- ✅ Edge cases (exactly 200%, missing allocation percentage)

**Key Validations:**
- Allocation percentage must be positive (> 0)
- Allocation percentage cannot exceed 200%
- Overallocation is allowed but tracked
- Both create and update operations are validated

### 3. `test-schema-additions.sql`
Updated the test database schema to include all necessary columns and tables for the integration tests.

**Schema Updates:**
- Added `worker_type` column to people table
- Added `scenarios` table for scenario assignments
- Added `scenario_project_assignments` table
- Fixed `person_roles` table to include `id` and `is_primary` columns

## Test Infrastructure

The tests follow the existing pattern in the project:
- Use Jest as the test runner
- Mock the database connection to use an in-memory SQLite database
- Mock external services (notifications) to prevent side effects
- Directly test controller methods rather than making HTTP requests

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run utilization report tests
npm test -- tests/integration/utilization-report-api.test.ts

# Run allocation validation tests  
npm test -- tests/integration/allocation-validation.test.ts

# Run both test suites
npm test -- tests/integration/utilization-report-api.test.ts tests/integration/allocation-validation.test.ts
```

## Results
All 15 tests are passing:
- 6 utilization report tests ✅
- 9 allocation validation tests ✅

The integration tests confirm that:
1. The utilization report correctly filters assignments by date range
2. Allocation percentages are calculated accurately
3. The allocation validation prevents invalid values (≤0% or >200%)
4. The system handles edge cases appropriately

These tests ensure the fixes for the blank utilization charts issue are working correctly and will catch any regressions in the future.
