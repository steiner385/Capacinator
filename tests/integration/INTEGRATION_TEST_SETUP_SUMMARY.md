# Integration Test Setup Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Created a proper test database injection system**:
   - Created `tests/integration/helpers/test-routes.ts` with factory functions that create Express routers with injected test database
   - Modified integration tests to use these factory functions instead of importing production routes
   - This ensures controllers use the test database instead of production database

2. **Set up in-memory test database**:
   - Using SQLite in-memory database for fast, isolated tests
   - Created `test-schema.sql` with minimal schema needed for testing
   - Database is created fresh for each test run

3. **Fixed most integration tests**:
   - 12 out of 14 tests are now passing
   - Tests properly clean up after themselves
   - Date handling fixed to use proper format for SQLite

## Key Files Created/Modified

1. `/tests/integration/helpers/test-routes.ts` - Factory functions for creating routes with test database
2. `/tests/integration/test-schema.sql` - Minimal database schema for tests
3. `/tests/integration/setup.ts` - Test database setup and teardown
4. `/tests/integration/phase-dependencies-api.test.ts` - Updated to use proper test infrastructure

## Remaining Issues

1. **Calculate Cascade Test**: The test expects cascading effects but the test data doesn't create the right dependency chain. The test needs to be updated to match the actual behavior.

2. **Apply Cascade Test**: Still failing with SQLite error. This might be due to:
   - Missing database constraints or tables
   - Transaction issues with SQLite
   - The service expecting different data structure

## How to Use This Setup for Other Integration Tests

When writing new integration tests:

```typescript
import { db } from './setup.js';
import { createControllerRouter } from './helpers/test-routes.js';

// Create test app with injected database
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
const router = createControllerRouter(db);
app.use('/api/endpoint', router);

// Use supertest to test the endpoints
const request = supertest(app);
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining two failing tests by:
   - Adjusting test expectations for calculate-cascade
   - Debugging the SQLite error in apply-cascade

2. Add more controller factory functions to `test-routes.ts` as needed

3. Consider creating a more complete test schema that matches production more closely if needed for complex tests
